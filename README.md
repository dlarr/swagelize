Generate Sequelize model definitions from a Swagger 2.0 schema <br/><br/>
Tasks the lib does:
- Generate sequelize structure folders and files with definitions and associations
    - Generate a folder models with index.js containing Sequelize configuration and initialisation
    - Generate all models from swagger definitions node
    - Generate associations within sequelize model files
        - As of today, only One to Many associations are covered due to lack of swagger spec support of data models feature (no primary key definitions, no cardinality definitions),
        - many to many associations
        - (YET TO COME) One to one associations,
        - (YET TO COME) Generate a dao folder with all methods described in swagger path node including parameters and sequelize glu code

Restrictions : this libray has been developed for MariaDB project needs, so I only tested it for MariaDB sequelization in a nodejs project

Other restriction:  <br/>
Swagger spec is not suitable for Model definitions, the lack of cardinality info doesn't allow us to perform proper definition. <br/>
I had to process some new fields in swagger spec, that are not covered by swagger spec to enable the cardinality feature and thus, proper generation of sequelize models. <br/>
Here after, what you need to do in order to specify cardinality: <br/>
- First of all, you must specify Primary keys in a special model attribute [x-primary-key], **it must be an array !!**: <br/>
```
"Pet": {
      "type": "object",
      ...
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "integer",
          "format": "int64"
        },
        ...
      },
      "x-primary-key": ["id"],
      ...
    },
```
- For Object arrays, you can specify a "throughTable" attribute, and that would means it's a N-N associations: <br/>
Example : <br/>

```
"Pet": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": [
        "name",
        "photoUrls"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "integer",
          "format": "int64"
        },
        "tags": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "$ref": "#/definitions/Tag"
          },
          "throughTable": "PetTag"
        },
      },
      "x-primary-key": ["id"],
    },
```

- Same thing goes for $ref objects : <br/>
here is a [Pet]N-----1..0[Category] association ( nullable: false would make it [Pet]N-----1[Category] )<br/>

```
"Pet": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "integer",
          "format": "int64"
        },
        "category": {
          "$ref": "#/definitions/Category",
          "nullable": true
        },
        ...
      },
      "x-primary-key": ["id"],
    },
```

Here is a [Pet]N-----N[Category] association:

```
"Pet": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "integer",
          "format": "int64"
        },
        "category": {
          "$ref": "#/definitions/Category",
          "throughTable": "PetCategory",
          "nullable": true
        },
        ...
      },
      "x-primary-key": ["id"],
    },
```

That will generate a table PetCategory with 2 fields id_pet, id_category as composed primary key, each being FK to respective tables. <br/>.
Note that, if the association table must have other fields, you don't have to specify the FKs. <br/>
Moreover, you need to specify that this is a throughTable, so that references won't be handle for this table.

```
"PetCategory": {
      "type": "object",
      "throughTable": true,
      "properties": {
        "pet": {
          "$ref": "#/definitions/Pet"
        },
        "tag": {
          "$ref": "#/definitions/Category"
        },
        "dateX": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "date-time"
        }
      }
    }
```

Prequisites: 

- Create a description of your REST service in a JSON format (see [http://swagger.io/](Swagger.io)) 
- Create your app and install (see [http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/](Sequelizejs.com))

Currently, the project simply maps Swagger-datatypes to their Sequelize counterpart.

Sample usage:

```js
var swagelize = require('swagelize');
var fs = require('fs');
var Sequelize = require('sequelize');

var sequelize = new Sequelize('<your uri>');
var swaggerSpec = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('<your swagger.json>', 'utf-8'));

swagelize.generateAll(swaggerSpec);

```

**This project is assuming you have configured sequelize through a config.js contained in a config folder as specified on sequelize docs**
example of config.js
```js
module.exports = {
    "local": {
        "username": "root",
        "password": "admin",
        "database": "TEST_SWAGUELIZE",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "dialect": "mysql",
        "port": "3306"
    }
};
```

In case you want to read from a `swagger.yaml` rather than from a `swagger.json`, you could replace the JSON-import

```js
var swaggerSpec = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('<your swagger.sjon>', 'utf-8'));
```

with a YAML-import
```js
var yaml = require('js-yaml');
var swaggerSpec = yaml.safeLoad(fs.readFileSync('<your swagger.yaml>', 'utf8'));
```

To be consistent, one should "officially" add js-yaml to the project:

```
npm install --save js-yaml
```
